<p>Anonymous has released a new video. The previous four, which were all titled, “Message to the people of the world,”. This one is titled, “Message to the United States Government 2016,” and they do NOT sound happy. Among the more memorable lines in the video is the following:</p>

<p>"As Iraq veterans against the war, we are resisting an occupation we once risked our lives for. We swore to support and defend the Constitution of the United States of America, and we found out the hard way, that the greatest enemies of the United States are not to be found in the sands of some far off land, they are right here at home!!!!!"</p>

<p>In part V of anonymous’ messages to the world, about how we are essentially already in WWIII, anonymous touches on 9/11.Anonymous discussed “melted steel”, along with building 7’s impossible predicted demise, and seems to fully acknowledge that 9/11 was a false flag operation.</p>
